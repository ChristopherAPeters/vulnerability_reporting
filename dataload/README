This directory contains programs that load the vulnerability definitions, assets and asset vulnerabilities
based on inputs of CSV files from Qualys & Bitsight.

examples:

1. Load vulnerability definitions:

	sudo ./vuln_loader.pl -i <Qualys report file>
	sudo ./vuln_loader.pl -b -i <Bitsight report file>

2. Find/update assets in the reports and populate the asset-vulnerability table, for a given reporting group/owner:

	sudo ./asset_loader.pl -i ../Scan_Report_Network_vulnerabilities_pg3cp_20210311.csv  -o Networks (in this example the group=Networks and Qualys is the data)
	sudo ./asset_loader.pl -b -i ../bitsight-technologies-Canada-findings-2021-03-05.csv -o Canada (in this example the owner is Canada and it is bitsight data) 


3. Important: programs must be run in the precise order - first the vuln_loader, then the asset_loader.  Once the programs are run they can be re-run, i.e. it will not
hurt anything to run them twice on the same dataset(s).

4. Once complete, change directory to /home/ubuntu/reports to find the reporting scripts.

5. Optional - if you want to just dump out the current list of owner groups from the DB
	sudo ./asset_loader.pl -g
