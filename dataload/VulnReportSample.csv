"10.64.1.8","Presence of a Load-Balancing Device Detected",80,1,"The service detected a load-balancing device in front of your Web servers. This information can provide an attacker with additional information about your network.\
 \
Different techniques were used to detect the presence of a load-balancing device, including HTTP header analysis and analysis of IP Time-To-Live (TTL) values, IP Identification (ID) values, and TCP Initial Sequence Numbers (ISN). The actual technique(s) responsible for the detection can be seen in the Result section.\
 \
The exact number of Web servers behind a load balancer is difficult to determine, so the number reported here may not be accurate. Furthermore, Netscape Enterprise Server Version 3.6 is known to display an erroneous \"Date:\" field in the HTTP header when the server receives a lot of requests. This makes it difficult for the service to determine if there is a load-balancing device present by analyzing the HTTP headers. Also, the result given by the analysis of IP ID and TCP ISN values may vary due to different network conditions when the scan was performed.","By exploiting this vulnerability, an intruder could use this information in conjunction with other pieces of information to craft sophisticated attacks against your network.\
 \
Note also that if the Web servers behind the load balancer are not identical, the scan results for the HTTP vulnerabilities may vary from one scan to another.",\N
