This is the directory containing the SQL queries needed to generate monthly vuln reports.

These should only be run after the data loader scripts have been run.

The scripts to run are named "run_report_<groupName>.sh" i.e. run_report_marketing.sh

Important - do not edit the .sql files unless you know what you're doing!
